# Methodology
Remote work is difficult to get if you're starting out at entry level (market saturation) unless you have experience, or they really need someone with your skill set.

Focus on getting a job locally (unless you really want a remote job) because the competition pool is obviously smaller. A local job might allow you to WFH. If not, you can shoot for a WFH position in your second job (probably the best option, seeing as you'll have more exp etc).

Have a solid resume (includes proper grammar, spelling, etc). IMHO having the experience or skills the job needs > having the best resume on the planet, trying to figure out how to beat the ATS system and reformatting your resume 100x.
        
The formula I've found to be really effective (wish I created some data on it) is:

- *Apply for twenty jobs a day. Shotgun your resume and cast a wide net. You're looking for callbacks. Once you get a call and the recruiter confirms an interview for you, THEN study the company that is interested in you at a very basic level. Make sure to keep some type of Excel sheet where you can keep track of the companies you applied to.*

- *Immediately send a follow-up email after applying. Some people will say "there's no point", "don't send one because it's too early", etc. This is what I found worked BEST in my experience.*

- *Once you get an offer, keep applying / interviewing. Worst-case scenario is you get rejected. Best-case scenario is you get another offer(s) that’s offer more than your current offer(s). Majority of recruiters are only there to benefit themselves, they’re not your friend. Be prepared for them to ghost you, etc. Even if you feel like you did really well on an interview some companies will still reject you. Don't ever stop applying even after a company Don't think anything of it, just keep clicking.*

- *Formula TLDR = Apply for 20 jobs per day (100 a week. I mainly used Indeed for the "Apply Now" feature) + send follow-up email immediately (create a copy-pasta) after applying.*

*Tip: You can use a password manager like Bitwarden where it allows you to store some of your information (first name, last name, address), to make it easier to autofill applications.*
